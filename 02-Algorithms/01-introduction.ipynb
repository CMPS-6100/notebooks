    "\n",
    "In our exploration of algorithms, we will examine practical examples. We'll look at existing algorithms and use them to establish our theoretical foundation for algorithm analysis. Along the way, we will introduce notations for algorithmic efficiency, algorithm design paradigms, and even the study of parallel algorithms."
